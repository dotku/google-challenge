# google-challenge
A git for preparing to get into to Google.

## Introduction
I don't expect I could get Google Full Time position, maybe a contractor position could be good enough; 
of course I would be more then happy to get into Google as FTE. Like what [TechLead](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4xKdmAXFh4ACyhpiQ_3qBw) said, geting into Google would be like 
getting a certain certification of Software Engineer in the industry.

## Programming Language

My background come from web development, and recent year Machine Learning getting popular, so I 
start moving into python. For this git repositiory, I would focus on JavaScript and Python or maybe 
Java.

Here is the programming languages primary used in Google for your reference.

1. C++
2. Python
3. Java
4. JavaScript
5. Golang

## Code Challenge
So far there are about 1,000 coding chellenge questions on LeetCode. Be honest, if you want to chllenge 
the code, Java might be easier for you, since most data strucuture is ready in Java while JavaScript might 
not have these data strucutre concept for you (maybe I will create a JavaScript repo to have them ready, 
which could an intereting project).
